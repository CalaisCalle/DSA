# DSA
A collection of simple Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA), written for learning and practise

## Introduction

Hello!
My name is Max Callé and I'm a software engineer working in the UK.
This repository largely serves two purposes: to grow and showcase my understanding of Computer Science, and to learn any new languages that might interest me.

I'm a self-taught developer and, as such, have no degree in Computer Science.
Although I have now worked as a software engineer for a few years, this may put me at a disadvantage compared to my peers.
The solution is to learn and show my understanding of the subject and the easiest way to do that is through uploading example code.
This repository is, first and foremost, a place to keep track of my progress for both myself and anyone inclined to take a look.

Further, I'm also of the opinion that a great way of learning the features and pitfalls of a new language is to re-create a decently-sized project into the said language.
Although it's not, strictly speaking, the best project to re-implement data structures and algorithms in a new language, it's not a bad start.

## Structure

Each data structure and algorithm will have it's own folder containing subfolders for each language with an implementation.
The top level folder of each algorithm will have an explanation, with some examples written in pseudocode.
Any diagrams/figures used in the explanation will be in their own folder.
So, for an algorithm I've implemented in Python and C++, the structure will look something like this:

  ```
  Main folder
  |
  |_ <name>
    |_ Resources
    |
    |_ Python
    | |_ implementation.py
    |
    |_ C++
    |_ README.md
  ```

The python examples are not particurly pythonic.

## Featured Languages

Initially, I'll be writing these examples in Python, then porting them to C++.
These are, arguably, my two strongest languages, so it makes the most sense to start here.
C++ also offers the opportunity to dive into some template metaprogamming, in addition to concrete solutions.

## Sources

  - Grokking Algorithms [Aditya Y. Bhargava], Manning Press
  - Data Structures and Algorithms with Python (2nd Ed.) [Kent D. Lee, Steve Hubbard], Springer Texts

While in a previous iteration of this repository used Grokking Algorithms as the main source, this turned out to be a slight mistake.
As the title implies, the focus of the book was on Algorithms, not data structures.
This becomes slightly useless for learning data structures when the implicit assumption is that you already have data structures on which to work.

I'd originally planned on using Introduction to Algorithms to supplement my understanding, I quickly found that I

  - Don't like using PDFs of books
  - Don't like spending £100+ on a single book
  - That the book contains so many algorithms as to be intimidating.

Eventually, I stumbled across Kent Lee and Steve Hubbard's book in a shop.
This seems like a happy medium, so here we ware.


## Comments:
  There'll be an open issue, "Feedback", where others can submit comments on the work if they so wish.
  IF you happen upon this and think that a particular topic may be a good fit, please don't hesitate to raise it as an issue.
