# DSA
A collection of simple Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA), written for learning and practise

## Introduction

Hello!
My name is Max Call√© and I'm a software engineer working in the UK.
This repository largely serves two purposes: to grow and showcase my understanding of Computer Science, and to learn any new languages that might interest me.

I'm a self-taught developer and, as such, have no degree in Computer Science.
Although I have now worked as a software engineer for a few years, this may put me at a disadvantage compared to my peers.
The solution is to learn and show my understanding of the subject and the easiest way to do that is through uploading example code.
This repository is, first and foremost, a place to keep track of my progress for both myself anyone inclined to take a look.

Right now, I primarily develop in C++; this is, where I have the most experience.
However, C++ is a very large language (some might say *too* large)* and I'd like to explore as much of it as I possibly can.
This is also true of other languages I've used in the past, including Python and C\#, and languages I'm very interested in learning (mostly Rust).
The best way to learn a new programming language is to use it in a project; so I'll be implementing DSAs in any language that I'm interested in.

There is a third, potential reason: One day, I'd like to put these up as reference materials for an informal course.
I'm currently working towards creating my own personal website, on which I'm planning to include a blog and any of my personal projects.
My hope is that I'll eventually be able to write up the knowledge I've gained for others to learn from; either as a course, or as simple reference sheets.
These, of course, already exist in multitudes, so the aim is not to become a hub for learning.
Rather, I like the idea of someone being able to use my website as a reference someday.

## Structure

Each data structure and algorithm will have it's own folder containing subfolders for each language with an implementation.
The top level folder of each algorithm will have an explanation, with some examples written in pseudocode.
Any diagrams/figures used in the explanation will be in their own folder.
So, for an algorithm I've implemented in Python and C++, the structuer will look something like this:

  ```
  Main folder
  |
  |_ <name>
    |_ Resources
    |
    |_ Python
    | |_ implementation.py
    |
    |_ C++
    |_ README.md
  ```

## Featured Languages

Initially, I'll be writing these examples in Python, then porting them to C++.
These are, arguably, my two strongest languages, so it makes the most sense to start here.
C++ also offers the opportunity to dive into some template metaprogamming, in addition to concrete solutions.

## Sources

In this section, I'll list any sources I use in creating these examples.
For now, there are two:

  - Grokking Algorithms, Aditya Y. Bhargava, Manning
  - Introduction to Algorithms, 4th Ed,  Thomas H. Cormen & Charles E. Leiserson, MIT Press


## Comments:
  There'll be an open issue, "Feedback", where others can submit comments on the work if they so wish.
  IF you happen upon this and think that a particular topic may be a good fit, please don't hesitate to raise it as an issue.
